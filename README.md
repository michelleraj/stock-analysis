# stock-analysis
# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to analyse teh entire stock data provided in the dataset below find the better choices of stock by analysing the provided stocks for the year 2017 and 2018 , find the ups and dips if any in the stocks using VBA macros. After conducting the conditional formating in the alasysis which is done for the 2017 and the 2018 we can see that the 2017 stocks have greater performance compared to the 2018. 2017 has only one dip in the stock market while for  2018 there have been only two successful returns for the stock. while comparing the execution scripts for the 2017 and 2018 we can observe that original script took about 2.5 seconds or more while the refactored script took only 0.10 seconds to run the code

# Summary

The major advantage of refactoring a code is that it helps to run the code in a faster time and the code is fresher, easier to understand or read, less complex . While disadvantage is that it takes time find out an efficient coding methods for refactoring in the long run

After applying the refactored code it definite did reduce the time by a factor of 10. While doing this challenge the goal was to remove the nested loop and use just one loop instead, and it was challenging to discover as well as undersatand diffreent way to do the same process with the code
